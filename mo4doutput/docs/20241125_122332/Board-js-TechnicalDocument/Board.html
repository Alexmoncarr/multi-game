 <h3>Explanation -</h3>
 <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>The provided React component, `Board`, implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game, supporting both single-player and multi-player modes. It utilizes React hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useCallback` for managing state and optimizing performance. <br><br>The component maintains an array of squares, each representing a cell in the Tic-Tac-Toe grid, initialized to `null`. The `xIsNext` state determines the current player's turn. The `handleClick` function updates the squares array with 'X' or 'O' depending on the player's turn and checks for a winner or an already occupied square before proceeding with the move.<br><br>For single-player mode, the AI uses the Minimax algorithm to determine the best move based on the current game state. The `minimax` function evaluates possible moves recursively, aiming to maximize the AI's chances of winning ('O') while minimizing the player's chances ('X'). The `findBestMove` function iterates through available squares, calling `minimax` to find the optimal move based on the difficulty setting.<br><br>The game state is monitored, and upon completion (either a win or draw), the board resets after a brief delay, allowing players to start anew. The `calculateWinner` function checks all possible winning combinations, returning the winner if found. It also assesses the game state for a draw using the `isMovesLeft` function.<br><br>The component renders the Tic-Tac-Toe grid using the `renderSquare` function, which creates individual Square components, and displays the current game status. Additionally, a button allows players to return to the home screen.<br><br>Overall, the `Board` component encapsulates the core logic of a Tic-Tac-Toe game, providing both a competitive and engaging user experience.</p>

        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game using React hooks, allowing for both single-player and two-player modes. It maintains the game state with the `squares` array, which tracks the board's state, and the `xIsNext` boolean to determine the current player. The `handleClick` function updates the board when a player makes a move, checks for a winner, and switches between players.<br><br>The minimax algorithm is used to determine the best move for the AI player when in single-player mode. The `minimax` function recursively evaluates potential moves, scoring them based on possible outcomes, favoring winning moves for 'O' (AI) and avoiding losing moves for 'X' (human). The `findBestMove` function calls `minimax` to identify the optimal move available.<br><br>Two `useEffect` hooks manage side effects in the game. The first monitors the game state to make the AI's move automatically based on the selected difficulty, either using the minimax function for hard difficulty or a random move for easier play. The second checks for game completion, resetting the board after a short delay if there is no winner and no remaining moves.<br><br>The game displays the current status (winner or next player) and renders the game board using the `renderSquare` function, which creates individual squares based on the current state. The `calculateWinner` function assesses potential win conditions, while `evaluate` scores the board based on player positions. Additional helper functions include `isMovesLeft` to check for available moves and `findRandomMove` for generating random moves for the AI.<br><br>Overall, this code establishes a functional Tic-Tac-Toe game while demonstrating the use of React hooks, callback functions, and game AI using the minimax algorithm.</p>

        <div class="hh2">Explain Method - resetBoard</div>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>The provided code snippet is a JavaScript fragment likely used in a React component for managing the state of a game board, such as Tic-Tac-Toe. <br><br>1. **setSquares Function**: The first line of the code initializes the game board by calling the `setSquares` function, which is presumably a state setter function provided by the React `useState` hook. The function is being passed an array filled with 9 `null` values using `Array(9).fill(null)`. This creates a new array representing an empty game board, where each position is initially set to `null`, indicating that no moves have been made yet.<br><br>2. **setXIsNext Function**: The second line calls the `setXIsNext` function, which is also likely a state setter function. This function is called with the boolean value `true`, indicating that the next player to take a turn will be 'X'. This is important for alternating turns in the game, where 'X' and 'O' take turns making their moves.<br><br>Overall, this code snippet is responsible for resetting the game state to start a new game. By initializing the squares to `null` and setting the next turn to 'X', it ensures that the game board is prepared for a fresh game session. The use of state management functions aligns with React's declarative approach to managing UI based on the underlying state. This snippet is likely part of a larger function or event handler that handles starting or resetting the game.</p>

        <p>**Time Complexity Analysis**<br><br>The provided code implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game with both single-player and multiplayer modes. The time complexity analysis is as follows:<br><br>1. **Handle Click (`handleClick` function)**:<br>   - The complexity is O(1) since it involves checking the winner and updating the state based on the current player's move, neither of which requires iterative processes over the board.<br><br>2. **Minimax Algorithm (`minimax` function)**:<br>   - The minimax algorithm explores the game tree to evaluate moves. In the worst case, it explores every possible board configuration.<br>   - The maximum depth of the tree is 9 (the number of squares), and each square can be filled in any of the remaining moves. Hence, the time complexity is O(b^d), where:<br>     - `b` is the branching factor (the number of empty squares at each move, which can be up to 9).<br>     - `d` is the depth of the game tree (up to 9).<br>   - Thus, in the worst case, the time complexity of the minimax function is O(9^9), which is impractical for large depths, but manageable for Tic-Tac-Toe.<br><br>3. **Finding the Best Move (`findBestMove` function)**:<br>   - This function iterates through all squares and calls the `minimax` function for each empty square. Thus, the time complexity for `findBestMove` is O(b^d) as well, leading to a total complexity of O(b^d * b), simplifying to O(b^(d+1)), which is still O(9^9) in the worst case due to the same reasoning as above.<br><br>4. **Calculating the Winner (`calculateWinner` function)**:<br>   - This function checks all possible winning combinations. It iterates through a fixed set of 8 lines, making the time complexity O(1).<br><br>5. **Evaluating the Board (`evaluate` function)**:<br>   - Similar to `calculateWinner`, it checks the same 8 lines for scoring purposes, resulting in a time complexity of O(1).<br><br>6. **Moves Left Check (`isMovesLeft` function)**:<br>   - This function scans through the squares to check for empty ones, resulting in a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of squares (9 in this case, so O(1)).<br><br>7. **Finding a Random Move (`findRandomMove` function)**:<br>   - This function creates an array of empty squares and selects one at random. The time complexity is O(n), which simplifies to O(1) given n is a constant (9 squares).<br><br>8. **Overall Complexity**:<br>   - The most significant contributor to the overall time complexity is the minimax algorithm during single-player mode. Thus, the overall time complexity for the game when using the minimax strategy is O(9^9) in the worst case.<br><br>In summary, while the Tic-Tac-Toe board operations (like checking for a winner or finding moves) are efficient (O(1)), the minimax algorithm introduces significant complexity, making the worst-case scenario for the single-player mode O(9^9). This should be considered when evaluating performance, especially in larger game trees or more complex game scenarios.</p>

        <div class="hh2"> Review </div>
        <p>**Code Review Summary**<br><br>**Identified Issues:**<br>1. **Magic Numbers**: The use of `10` and `-10` in the `evaluate` function lacks context. Consider defining constants to improve readability.<br>2. **Redundant Logic**: The `evaluate` function and the `calculateWinner` function both iterate through the same winning lines. This could be refactored to use a single source of truth.<br>3. **Potential Infinite Loops**: In `findBestMove`, if `squares` is in a state where no best move can be found, ensure that the function handles this gracefully.<br><br>**Recommendations for Improvement:**<br>1. **Separate Logic**: Consider splitting logic into separate utility functions or files (e.g., `gameUtils.js`) for better maintainability and testing.<br>2. **Memoization**: Although you are using `useCallback`, consider using `useMemo` for derived states that do not change frequently, such as winner calculations.<br>3. **User Experience**: The timeout in `useEffect` for resetting the board could be improved by providing user feedback or an animation when the game ends.<br><br>**Areas of Strength:**<br>1. **Use of Hooks**: The implementation of hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, and `useCallback`) is well done and aligns with React best practices.<br>2. **Single Responsibility**: Each function appears to have a single responsibility, which is a good coding practice.<br>3. **Readable Structure**: The structure of the component is clear, making it easy to follow the game logic.<br><br>**Potential Bugs:**<br>1. **State Dependency Issues**: The dependency array in the `useEffect` that handles the AI's move includes `squares`. If `squares` changes, it could trigger multiple unnecessary renders or calls to `handleClick`.<br>2. **Reset Logic**: The reset logic does not account for the case where a user might want to reset the game mid-play. Ensure this logic is user-triggered for clarity.<br><br>**Performance Bottlenecks:**<br>1. **Minimax Function**: The `minimax` algorithm can be computationally expensive. Consider implementing alpha-beta pruning to optimize performance against larger game states.<br><br>**Security Vulnerabilities:**<br>- No immediate security vulnerabilities were identified in this code. However, ensure that any user inputs or external data are sanitized if added in future features.<br><br>**Overall Code Quality Assessment:**<br>**Score: 7/10**<br>- The code is well-structured and leverages modern React features, but improvements in readability, performance optimization, and handling edge cases would elevate its quality further.</p>
