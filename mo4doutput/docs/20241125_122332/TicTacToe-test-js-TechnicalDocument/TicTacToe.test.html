 <h3>Explanation -</h3>
 <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>The provided code is a test suite for a TicTacToe React component using the React Testing Library. It contains two main test cases that verify the functionality and rendering of the TicTacToe component.<br><br>1. **Rendering Test**: The first test case, `renders TicTacToe component`, checks if the TicTacToe component renders correctly. It utilizes the `render` function to mount the component in a virtual DOM environment, simulating the user interface. The test verifies that the text "Tic Tac Toe" is present in the document after rendering, ensuring that the component displays the expected title.<br><br>2. **Interaction Test**: The second test case, `handles square click correctly`, focuses on testing the interaction with the game. It first simulates a click on the "Single Player (Medium)" button, which presumably starts a new game or sets the game mode. After that, it retrieves all button elements representing the Tic Tac Toe squares using `getAllByRole`. The test then simulates a click on the first square (squares[0]) and asserts that the square's text content changes to 'X', indicating that the player's move has been registered correctly.<br><br>Both tests utilize the `fireEvent` method, which allows simulating user interactions with the component. The assertions made by `expect` confirm that the expected outcomes occur, thus validating the component's behavior during rendering and user interaction.<br><br>Overall, this test suite ensures that the TicTacToe component functions as intended by validating both its initial rendering and the interactivity of its game squares. This provides a solid foundation for maintaining the component's reliability as it evolves or undergoes further development.</p>

        <p>**Time Complexity Analysis**<br><br>The provided code snippet consists of two tests for a Tic Tac Toe component using React Testing Library. Each test performs actions and assertions that help to verify the functionality of the component.<br><br>1. **Test: 'renders TicTacToe component'**<br>   - The `render` function is called to create an instance of the `TicTacToe` component. This function has a time complexity of O(1) since it initializes the component without any loops or recursive calls.<br>   - The `getByText` function is used to query the rendered output. This function typically has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the DOM. In this case, it is searching for a specific text.<br>   - The assertion `toBeInTheDocument()` is an O(1) operation, as it simply checks the presence of the queried element.<br><br>   Overall, the time complexity for this test can be approximated to O(n), where n is the number of elements rendered by the component.<br><br>2. **Test: 'handles square click correctly'**<br>   - Similar to the first test, the `render` function has a time complexity of O(1).<br>   - The `fireEvent.click` operation on the "Single Player (Medium)" button is also O(1) as it targets a specific element.<br>   - The `getAllByRole` function retrieves all button elements, which has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of buttons.<br>   - The second `fireEvent.click` operation on the first square button is O(1), as it directly accesses a specific button in the array of square buttons.<br>   - Finally, the assertion `toHaveTextContent('X')` is O(1) as it checks the content of the specific button.<br><br>   Thus, the overall time complexity for this test can also be approximated to O(n), where n represents the number of button elements.<br><br>**Conclusion**<br>In summary, both tests exhibit a time complexity of O(n) due to the use of DOM queries that depend on the number of elements present. The constant time operations involved in rendering and assertions do not affect the overall linear complexity in relation to the number of elements queried.</p>

    <section id="review-comment">
        <div class="hh2"> Review </div>
        <p>**Code Review Summary**<br><br>1. **Identified Issues**:<br>   - There is a lack of test coverage for various scenarios such as player two's move, win conditions, and edge cases (e.g., clicking on an already occupied square).<br>   - The test for the "handles square click correctly" function does not verify if the game state updates correctly after the first move.<br><br>2. **Recommendations for Improvement**:<br>   - Expand test coverage to include all possible game scenarios, including player two's moves, win conditions, and reset functionality.<br>   - Add assertions to verify the game state after each action (e.g., checking if the next player's turn is displayed correctly).<br>   - Consider adding a test case for the "onBackToHome" prop to ensure it is called appropriately.<br><br>3. **Areas of Strength**:<br>   - The basic structure of the tests is clear and follows good practices by using `@testing-library/react`.<br>   - The initial render test effectively checks if the component renders correctly.<br><br>4. **Potential Bugs**:<br>   - If the game logic does not handle invalid moves (e.g., clicking on an already occupied square), it could lead to unexpected behavior. Ensure that the TicTacToe component has proper validation in place.<br><br>5. **Performance Bottlenecks**:<br>   - Currently, there are no apparent performance issues, but if additional tests are added, keep an eye on how the component's performance is affected, especially if it handles complex game logic.<br><br>6. **Security Vulnerabilities**:<br>   - There are no immediate security vulnerabilities identified in this snippet, but always ensure that the component properly sanitizes any user input or interactions.<br><br>7. **Overall Code Quality Assessment**: <br>   - **Score**: 6/10. While the code adheres to basic testing principles and is cleanly written, it lacks comprehensive coverage and thorough testing practices. Enhancing the test cases will significantly improve the overall quality.</p>
